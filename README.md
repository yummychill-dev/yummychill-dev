## Skills

### Data Wrangling & Integration:
- Proficient in data cleaning, handling missing values, feature transformations, and integrating data from multiple sources.
- Strong knowledge of libraries: `Pandas`, `NumPy`.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Expertise in statistical analysis and visualization for identifying data distributions and patterns.
- Proficient in using visualization tools like `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`.

### Data Preprocessing:
- Feature engineering, data scaling, and normalization techniques.
- Techniques for handling imbalanced datasets using resampling methods and feature encoding.
- Experience with dimensionality reduction (`Principal Component Analysis`) and low-pass filtering for temporal and frequency analysis.

### Predictive Modeling:
- Experience with machine learning algorithms: supervised learning (`MLPClassifier`, `RandomForest`, `SVM`, `DecisionTree`) and unsupervised learning (`KMeans`).
- Proficient in model evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, precision, and confusion matrix visualization.
- Model tuning through hyperparameter optimization using `GridSearchCV`.

### Natural Language Processing (NLP):
- Worked with NLP models using BERT for sequence classification, fine-tuning, and using `Hugging Face transformers`.
### Time-Series & Frequency Analysis:
- Knowledge of numerical abstraction, frequency transformation (`Fourier Transformation`), and temporal analysis for time-series data.

### Programming & Tools:
- **Python**: Strong proficiency with machine learning and data manipulation libraries (`Scikit-learn`, `Transformers`, `Statsmodels`, `PyTorch`).
- **SQL**: Familiarity with writing queries for data extraction and aggregation.
- Experience in version control with `Git` for collaborative development.

### Communication:
- **Data storytelling**: Able to convey insights effectively to technical and non-technical stakeholders.
